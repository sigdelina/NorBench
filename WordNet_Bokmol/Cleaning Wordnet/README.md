# Mofification of the Wordnet


There are some errors in original Wordnet. This is why it was decided to use scripts from the [repository](https://github.com/heisand/NWN) to modify wordnet and after that run all the models again.

Based on the code provided on the current link, errors were solved. Moreover, code was adapted to make modification more accurate (some part of the code were worth correcting because there were mistakes in there).
